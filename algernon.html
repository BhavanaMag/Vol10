<p>
Flowers for Algernon is a science fiction novel written by Daniel Keyes. 
  This book dives into topics such as intelligence and humanity, and whether 
  being smart is the same thing as being happy. It is deeply emotional and philosophical. 
  The main character is a 32-year-old man named Charlie Gordon who has an 
  intellectual disability, and his IQ is around 60. Despite this, he tries his best to be kind. 
  The book is written in journal entry format, as progress reports written by 
  Charlie himself.  He has been taking classes at a disabled adult learning center 
  to “become smarter”. His uncle has got him a job at a bakery where he cleans. 
  He is frequently made fun of because of his disability, specifically by his 
  coworkers at the bakery. To become smart, he undergoes an experimental procedure 
  to increase his intelligence. This procedure has already been tested on a mouse 
  named Algernon. After Charlie’s operation, although progress is initially slow, 
  he begins to gain intelligence at a very fast rate, becoming smarter than most 
  humans around him. He then realizes that people who he thought were his friends 
  were mocking him and making fun of him for his disability, playing on the fact that 
  he was unable to understand their true intentions. He then develops feelings for the 
  person who taught him at the learning center, Alice Kinnian. But, as Charlie becomes 
  smarter, he realizes that his emotional growth is not nearly as fast as his intelligence 
  is growing, making emotions a major obstacle in his path. While Charlie is experiencing his 
  new intelligent life, Algernon slowly loses his intelligence, regresses, and then dies. 
  Charlie realizes that a similar effect could happen to him, and he calls it the Algernon-Gordon effect. 
  Eventually, Charlie’s abilities and intelligence begin to regress like Algernon’s, and 
  he eventually becomes who he was before, unable to read and write well, and 
  understand people as well as he did previously. However, Charlie is now aware 
  of what he has lost and does not understand why he became “dumb” again. 
  The novel concludes with Charlie planning to leave New York and 
asking his teacher and former love, Alice Kinnian, to “leave some flowers on Algernon’s grave”.

	This book emphasizes that we are all human, no matter where we come from 
  or who we are. By reading, you will gain a new perspective on humanity, 
  on how we should treat people, and the true potential we all have. This was 
  a great book to read and had a very engaging plot and characters, in which each character contributed something.
