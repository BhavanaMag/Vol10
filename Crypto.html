<h4>Encrypted Famous Quotes</h4> <br>
<p>If I asked you what "O SOAT OET EKTQD" meant, 
  you would think I was crazy, because this doesn’t 
  make any sense whatsoever! But, what if I told you
  this means “I like ice cream”? Well, there are many ways
  to hide information from other people around you. This is
  called cryptography, or secure communication. Cryptography
  is used to hide various forms of data, such as passwords, important messages,
  and other things. When using cryptography, many different ciphers 
  may be used to hide data. One simple form of this is called 
  the “Substitution Cipher”, specifically a monoalphabetic 
  substitution cipher. This cipher takes your message, 
  say “I love ice cream”, and replaces each letter of the 
  alphabet with a new letter. In this new alphabet, 
  you could assign “a” to “g” and “b” to z. 
</p> <br>
Alphabet:<br>
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ <br>

Example cipher alphabet: <br><br>
BCAFDEIHG… <br>
<p>
This makes it so that the new message created with this 
  alphabet is the same length, but has completely different 
  letters, resulting in something like “O SOAT OET EKTQD”. 
  An easy way to break this cipher is by trial and error. 
  You can determine letters in a manner like you see that 
  there is one letter in this spot, so it may be a word 
  like “I” or “a”, as well as there are two letters here, 
  so it could be a word like “so” or “or”. As you work through 
  different combinations, think of all the possibilities a letter 
  could be based on its length, and select options that 
  make sense based on what you’ve already worked out. Try it out!
