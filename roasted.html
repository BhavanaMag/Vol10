Everyone has their favorite vegetables to roast. 
My list includes pumpkins of various kinds when in season
-- including the basic pumpkin, butternut squash, acorn 
squash, and spagetti squash; carrots, parsnip, potatoes,
onions. Peel, wash and dry them and chop into relatively
large chunks. Season with olive oil, salt and pepper and 
if you are a fan of garlic, add in a dash of it too!
Roast in the oven at 375F for about an hour, until vegetables
are tender and falls apart from a fork easily. I like mine
with a little brown crust on top, but one needs to be careful
to have this -- a little less oil does the trick, but it is an
art to balance the amount of oil. 
Use thyme or rosemary sprigs, or chopped coriander leaves 
for garnish.
